# Data Visualisation - Exploration

Now that you've demonstrated your software is setup, and you have the basics of data manipulation, the goal of this assignment is to practice transforming, visualising, and exploring data.

# Mass shootings in the US

In July 2012, in the aftermath of a mass shooting in a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, [Mother Jones](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/07/mass-shootings-map/) published a report on mass shootings in the United States since 1982. Importantly, they provided the underlying data set as [an open-source database](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/) for anyone interested in studying and understanding this criminal behavior.

## Obtain the data

## Explore the data

### Specific questions

-   Generate a data frame that summarizes the number of mass shootings per year.

```{r}
mass_shootings %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  arrange(count)
```

-   Generate a bar chart that identifies the number of mass shooters associated with each race category. The bars should be sorted from highest to lowest and each bar should show its number.

```{r}
mass_shootings %>%
  mutate(race = ifelse(is.na(race), "Unknown", race)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(race)) %>% 
  group_by(race) %>% 
  summarise(race_count = n()) %>% 
  mutate(race = fct_rev(fct_reorder(race, race_count, max))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x =race, y=race_count))+
  geom_bar(position = 'dodge', stat='identity')+
  theme_minimal(base_size=6) +
  geom_text(aes(label=race_count), position=position_dodge(width=0.9), vjust=-0.25) +
  labs(x = "Race") +
  ggtitle("Mass shooters in the US are predominantly white") +
  ggthemes::theme_economist()

  
```

-   Generate a boxplot visualizing the number of total victims, by type of location.

```{r}
mass_shootings %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = location_type, y = total_victims)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Location Type", y = "Total Victim Count") +
  ggtitle("Most Mass Shootings have between 5-30 victims")


```

-   Redraw the same plot, but remove the Las Vegas Strip massacre from the dataset.

```{r}
{r}
mass_shootings %>%
  filter(case != 'Las Vegas Strip massacre') %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = location_type, y = total_victims)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Location Type", y = "Total Victim Count") +
  ggtitle("Most Mass Shootings have between 5-30 victims")

```

### More open-ended questions

Address the following questions. Generate appropriate figures/tables to support your conclusions.

-   How many white males with prior signs of mental illness initiated a mass shooting after 2000?

```{r}
mass_shootings %>%
  mutate(race = ifelse(is.na(race), "Unknown", race)) %>% 
  mutate(prior_mental_illness = ifelse(is.na(prior_mental_illness), "Unknown", prior_mental_illness)) %>% 
  filter(male & race == 'White' & year > 2000) %>% 
  group_by(prior_mental_illness) %>% 
  summarise(pmi_count = n()) %>% 
  mutate(prior_mental_illness = fct_rev(fct_reorder(prior_mental_illness, pmi_count, max))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x =prior_mental_illness, y=pmi_count))+
  geom_bar(position = 'dodge', stat='identity')+
  theme_minimal(base_size=6) +
  geom_text(aes(label=pmi_count), position=position_dodge(width=0.9), vjust=-0.25) +
  labs(x = "Prior Mental Illness", y='') +
  ggtitle("Most White Male Mass-Shooters display signs of prior mental illness") +
  ggthemes::theme_economist() + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14))  # Adjust the size value as needed
```

-   Which month of the year has the most mass shootings? Generate a bar chart sorted in chronological (natural) order (Jan-Feb-Mar- etc) to provide evidence of your answer.

```{r}
mass_shootings %>%
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarise(month_count = n()) %>% 
  mutate(month_num = as.numeric(match(month, month.abb))) %>% 
  mutate(month = fct_reorder(month, month_num, max)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x =month, y=month_count))+
  geom_bar(position = 'dodge', stat='identity')+
  theme_minimal(base_size=6) +
  geom_text(aes(label=month_count), position=position_dodge(width=0.9), vjust=-0.25) +
  labs(x = "Month", y='', subtitle = "Less shooting happen in summer months") +
  ggtitle('Most shootings happen in Feb, the shortest month') +
  ggthemes::theme_economist() + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14))  # Adjust the size value as needed
```

-   How does the distribution of mass shooting fatalities differ between White and Black shooters? What about White and Latino shooters?

```{r}
mass_shootings %>% 
  filter(race %in% c('White', 'Black')) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = fatalities, fill = race)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.6) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue", "red"),
                  guide = guide_legend(override.aes = list(alpha = 1))) +
  labs(x = "Fatalities", y='Freqiency', subtitle = "") +
  ggtitle('Shootings perpretrated by black mass shooters tend to have fewer fatalities') +
  ggthemes::theme_economist() + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 10))  # Adjust the size value as needed

mass_shootings %>% 
  filter(race %in% c('White', 'Latino')) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = fatalities, fill = race)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.6) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue", "green"),
                  guide = guide_legend(override.aes = list(alpha = 1))) +
  labs(x = "Fatalities", y='Freqiency', subtitle = "") +
  ggtitle('Similarly with Latino') +
  ggthemes::theme_economist() + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 10))  # Adjust the size value as needed
```

### Very open-ended

-   Are mass shootings with shooters suffering from mental illness different from mass shootings with no signs of mental illness in the shooter?

```{r}
mass_shootings %>%
  mutate(fatality_ratio = fatalities/total_victims) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = prior_mental_illness, y = fatality_ratio)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Fatality ratios (Fatalities/Total Victims) are more concentrated\namongst those without prior mental illness sign",
       x = "Prior Mental Illness",
       y = "Fatality Ratio",
       subtitle = "Suggests that those without prior mental illness signs\ncould have a more methodological approach to their crime") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue", "red", "gray"), 
                    labels = c("Yes", "No", "Unknown")) +
  ggthemes::theme_economist() + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14))  # Adjust the size value as needed


mass_shootings %>%
  mutate(race = fct_infreq(race)) %>%
  group_by(race, prior_mental_illness) %>% 
  summarise(avg_age = mean(age_of_shooter, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = race, y = avg_age, fill = prior_mental_illness)) +
  geom_tile(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "For black mass shooters, those with prior mental health\nillness signs tend to be older than those without",
       x = "Race",
       y = "Average Age",
       subtitle = "White mass shooters tend to be a similar age\nregardless of whether they have had prior mental illness signs") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue", "red", "gray"), 
                    labels = c("Yes", "No", "Unknown")) +
  ggthemes::theme_economist() + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14))  # Adjust the size value as needed
```

-   Assess the relationship between mental illness and total victims, mental illness and location type, and the intersection of all three variables.

```{r}

mass_shootings %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = prior_mental_illness, y = total_victims)) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(quantile(mass_shootings$total_victims, 0.05), quantile(mass_shootings$total_victims, 0.95))) +

                    labels = c("Yes", "No", "Unknown")) +
  ggthemes::theme_economist() + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14))  # Adjust the size value as needed


mass_shootings %>%

  # Restrict Location Type to only workplace school or other
  mutate(location_type = case_when(
    location_type %in% c("Workplace", "School") ~ as.character(location_type),
    TRUE ~ "Other"
  )) %>%

       x = "Prior Mental Illness",
       y = "Total Victims (Median)",
       subtitle = "This trend is more pronounced amongst those with prior mental health illness") +
  ggthemes::theme_economist() + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14))  # Adjust the size value as needed
```

```{=html}
<span style="color:red">
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear that those with prior signs of mental illness have a more volatility in total victim and fatality ratios in their shootings. This may be because the crimes are less pre-planned.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Workplaces and schools tend to be the most populated locations for mass shooters regardless of their mental health illness status. Interestingly, mass shooters who have committed their crimes in Military or Airport facilities have not had prior mental illness signs. This may be because of the higher security clearance needed to work in these locations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite schools being less common mass shooting locations than workplaces or others, they tend to have a higher median number of total victims. This discrepancy tends to be higher in shooters with prior mental health illness.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In general, black mass shooters tend to be older than white mass shooters. For white mass shooters, those with prior mental illness tend to be younger than those without. For black and Latino mass shooters, those with prior mental illness tend to be older.</p>

Make sure to provide a couple of sentences of written interpretation of your tables/figures. Graphs and tables alone will not be sufficient to answer this question.

# Exploring credit card fraud

We will be using a dataset with credit card transactions containing legitimate and fraud transactions. Fraud is typically well below 1% of all transactions, so a naive model that predicts that all transactions are legitimate and not fraudulent would have an accuracy of well over 99%-- pretty good, no? (well, not quite as we will see later in the course)

You can read more on credit card fraud on [Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Weighted Support Vector Machine](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=105944)

The dataset we will use consists of credit card transactions and it includes information about each transaction including customer details, the merchant and category of purchase, and whether or not the transaction was a fraud.

## Obtain the data

The dataset is too large to be hosted on Canvas or Github, so please download it from dropbox <https://www.dropbox.com/sh/q1yk8mmnbbrzavl/AAAxzRtIhag9Nc_hODafGV2ka?dl=0> and save it in your `dsb` repo, under the `data` folder

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false

card_fraud <- read_csv(here::here("data", "card_fraud.csv"))

glimpse(card_fraud)
```

The data dictionary is as follows

| column(variable)      | description                                 |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| trans_date_trans_time | Transaction DateTime                        |
| trans_year            | Transaction year                            |
| category              | category of merchant                        |
| amt                   | amount of transaction                       |
| city                  | City of card holder                         |
| state                 | State of card holder                        |
| lat                   | Latitude location of purchase               |
| long                  | Longitude location of purchase              |
| city_pop              | card holder's city population               |
| job                   | job of card holder                          |
| dob                   | date of birth of card holder                |
| merch_lat             | Latitude Location of Merchant               |
| merch_long            | Longitude Location of Merchant              |
| is_fraud              | Whether Transaction is Fraud (1) or Not (0) |

-   In this dataset, how likely are fraudulent transactions? Generate a table that summarizes the number and frequency of fraudulent transactions per year.

```{r}

card_fraud %>%
  group_by(trans_year, is_fraud) %>%
  count() %>%
  group_by(trans_year) %>% 
  mutate(Percentage = n / sum(n) * 100) %>%  
  filter(is_fraud == 1)

## 0.57% were fraud in 2019 (2721 Transactions)
## 0.63% in 2020 (1215 Transactions)
```

-   How much money (in US\$ terms) are fraudulent transactions costing the company? Generate a table that summarizes the total amount of legitimate and fraudulent transactions per year and calculate the % of fraudulent transactions, in US\$ terms.

```{r}

card_fraud %>%
  group_by(trans_year, is_fraud) %>%
  summarise(total_usd_amt = sum(amt)) %>%
  group_by(trans_year) %>% 
  mutate(pct_total_usd_amt = total_usd_amt / sum(total_usd_amt) * 100) %>%  
  filter(is_fraud == 1)

## In terms of total USD amount, fraudulent transactions represent 
## a higher proportion of total transactions 4.2% in 2019, 4.8% in 2020
```

-   Generate a histogram that shows the distribution of amounts charged to credit card, both for legitimate and fraudulent accounts. Also, for both types of transactions, calculate some quick summary statistics.

```{r}
card_fraud %>% 
  mutate(is_fraud = ifelse(is_fraud == 1, "Yes", "No")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = amt, fill = is_fraud)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.6) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue", "green"),
                  guide = guide_legend(override.aes = list(alpha = 1))) +
  labs(x = "Amount USD", y='Density', subtitle = "") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(quantile(card_fraud$amt, 0.00), quantile(card_fraud$amt, 0.99))) +
  ggtitle('Similarly with Latino') +
  ggthemes::theme_economist() + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 10)) +  # Adjust the size value as needed
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = round(seq(min(card_fraud$amt), quantile(card_fraud$amt, 0.99), length.out = 20), digits = 0)
)
```

-   What types of purchases are most likely to be instances of fraud? Consider category of merchants and produce a bar chart that shows % of total fraudulent transactions sorted in order.

```{r}
num_fraud <- card_fraud %>%
  filter(is_fraud == 1) %>%
  count() %>% 
  pull(n)

card_fraud %>%
  filter(is_fraud == 1 & !is.na(category)) %>%
  mutate(category = fct_infreq(category)) %>%
  group_by(category) %>%
  summarize(pct_fraud_transactions = n() / num_fraud * 100) %>%  
  ggplot(aes(x = category, y = pct_fraud_transactions)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Groceries ands Online Shopping are\nthe most common fraudulent transactions categories",
       x = "",
       y = "Percentage of Fradulent Transactions",
       subtitle = "") +
  ggthemes::theme_economist() + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.85))  # Adjust the size value as needed

  ntheme()

```

-   When is fraud more prevalent? Which days, months, hours? To create new variables to help you in your analysis, we use the `lubridate` package and the following code

```{r}

card_fraud_date <- card_fraud %>% 
                  mutate(

                    hour = lubridate::hour(trans_date_trans_time),
                    weekday = lubridate::wday(trans_date_trans_time, label = TRUE),
                    weekday_num = lubridate::wday(trans_date_trans_time, label = FALSE)
                    )

-   Are older customers significantly more likely to be victims of credit card fraud? To calculate a customer's age, we use the `lubridate` package and the following code

```         
  mutate(
   age = interval(dob, trans_date_trans_time) / years(1),
    )
```

```{r}
card_fraud_dob <- card_fraud %>% 
                   mutate(
                  age = interval(dob, trans_date_trans_time) / years(1),)

card_fraud_dob %>%

-   Is fraud related to distance? The distance between a card holder's home and the location of the transaction can be a feature that is related to fraud. To calculate distance, we need the latidue/longitude of card holders's home and the latitude/longitude of the transaction, and we will use the [Haversine formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula) to calculate distance. I adapted code to [calculate distance between two points on earth](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-distance-two-points-earth/amp/) which you can find below

```{r}
# distance between card holder's home and transaction
# code adapted from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-distance-two-points-earth/amp/


card_fraud <- card_fraud %>%
  mutate(
    
    # convert latitude/longitude to radians
    lat1_radians = lat / 57.29577951,
    lat2_radians = merch_lat / 57.29577951,
    long1_radians = long / 57.29577951,
    long2_radians = merch_long / 57.29577951,
    
    # calculate distance in miles
    distance_miles = 3963.0 * acos((sin(lat1_radians) * sin(lat2_radians)) + cos(lat1_radians) * cos(lat2_radians) * cos(long2_radians - long1_radians)),

    # calculate distance in km
    distance_km = 6377.830272 * acos((sin(lat1_radians) * sin(lat2_radians)) + cos(lat1_radians) * cos(lat2_radians) * cos(long2_radians - long1_radians))

  )


card_fraud %>%
  mutate(is_fraud = ifelse(is_fraud == 1, "Yes", "No")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = is_fraud, y = distance_miles)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Is Fraud", y = "Distance (Miles)") +
  labs(title = "There doesnt see to be much distinction between\ntransaction distances between fraud and non fraudulent transaction",
     x = "Age",
     y = "Number of Fradulent Transactions",
     subtitle = "This means that most fradulent transactions\nare made the same distanes away from the cardholders home")

```

Plot a boxplot or a violin plot that looks at the relationship of distance and `is_fraud`. Does distance seem to be a useful feature in explaining fraud?

# Exploring sources of electricity production, CO2 emissions, and GDP per capita.

There are many sources of data on how countries generate their electricity and their CO2 emissions. I would like you to create three graphs:

## 1. A stacked area chart that shows how your own country generated its electricity since 2000.

You will use

`geom_area(colour="grey90", alpha = 0.5, position = "fill")`

## 2. A scatter plot that looks at how CO2 per capita and GDP per capita are related

## 3. A scatter plot that looks at how electricity usage (kWh) per capita/day GDP per capita are related

We will get energy data from the Our World in Data website, and CO2 and GDP per capita emissions from the World Bank, using the `wbstats`package.

Specific questions:

1.  How would you turn `energy` to long, tidy format?
2.  You may need to join these data frames
    -   Use `left_join` from `dplyr` to [join the tables](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html)
    -   To complete the merge, you need a unique *key* to match observations between the data frames. Country names may not be consistent among the three dataframes, so please use the 3-digit ISO code for each country
    -   An aside: There is a great package called [`countrycode`](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/countrycode) that helps solve the problem of inconsistent country names (Is it UK? United Kingdom? Great Britain?). `countrycode()` takes as an input a country's name in a specific format and outputs it using whatever format you specify.
3.  Write a function that takes as input any country's name and returns all three graphs. You can use the `patchwork` package to arrange the three graphs as shown below

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "electricity-co2-gdp.png"), error = FALSE)
```

# Deliverables

There is a lot of explanatory text, comments, etc. You do not need these, so delete them and produce a stand-alone document that you could share with someone. Knit the edited and completed R Markdown (qmd) file as a Word or HTML document (use the "Knit" button at the top of the script editor window) and upload it to Canvas. You must be comitting and pushing your changes to your own Github repo as you go along.

# Rubric

13/13: Problem set is 100% completed. Every question was attempted and answered, and most answers are correct. Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled. Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret the output. Multiple Github commits. Work is exceptional. I will not assign these often.

8/13: Problem set is 60--80% complete and most answers are correct. This is the expected level of performance. Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output). A few Github commits.

5/13: Problem set is less than 60% complete and/or most answers are incorrect. This indicates that you need to improve next time. I will hopefully not assign these often. Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed. No Github commits.
