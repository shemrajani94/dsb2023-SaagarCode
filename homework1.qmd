# Data Manipulation

## Problem 1: Use logical operators to find flights that:

```         
-   Had an arrival delay of two or more hours (\> 120 minutes)
-   Flew to Houston (IAH or HOU)
-   Were operated by United (`UA`), American (`AA`), or Delta (`DL`)
-   Departed in summer (July, August, and September)
-   Arrived more than two hours late, but didn't leave late
-   Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight
```

```{r}
#| label: problem-1

# Had an arrival delay of two or more hours (> 120 minutes)
del_2hr <- flights %>% 
  filter(arr_delay > 120)
print(del_2hr)

# Flew to Houston (IAH or HOU)
dest_hous_iah <- flights %>% 
  filter(dest %in% c("HOU", "IAH"))
print(dest_hous_iah)


# Were operated by United (`UA`), American (`AA`), or Delta (`DL`)
opr_UA_AA_DL <- flights %>% 
  filter(carrier %in% c("UA", "AA", "DL"))
print(opr_UA_AA_DL)


# Departed in summer (July, August, and September)
dep_sum <- flights %>% 
  filter(month %in% c(7, 8, 9))
print(dep_sum)

  
# Arrived more than two hours late, but didn't leave late
arr_hr_late <- flights %>% 
  filter(arr_delay > 120 &  dep_delay <= 0)
print(arr_hr_late)


# Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight
made_up30<- flights %>% 
  filter((dep_delay-arr_delay) > 30 & (dep_delay >= 60))
print(made_up30)


```

## Problem 2: What months had the highest and lowest proportion of cancelled flights? Interpret any seasonal patterns. To determine if a flight was cancelled use the following code

```{r}
#| label: problem-2

# What months had the highest and lowest % of cancelled flights?

# Filter to all flights that were cancelled and count per month
cancelled <- flights %>% 
  filter(is.na(dep_time)) %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarise(count_cancel = n() )

# Filter for all flights
all_flights_count <- flights %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarise(count_total = n() )

#
all_flights_count %>% 
  left_join(cancelled, by = "month") %>%
  mutate(prop = count_cancel/count_total ) %>% 
  arrange(desc(month))
```

## Problem 3: What plane (specified by the `tailnum` variable) traveled the most times from New York City airports in 2013? Please `left_join()` the resulting table with the table `planes` (also included in the `nycflights13` package).

For the plane with the greatest number of flights and that had more than 50 seats, please create a table where it flew to during 2013.

```{r}
#Assuming that only JFK and LaGuardia qualify as new york airports

flights %>% 
  # Filter out cancelled flghts
  filter(!is.na(dep_time) & year == 2013) %>% 
  # Filter NYC Takeoffs
  filter(origin  %in% c("JFK", "LGA")) %>% 
  # Left join on tailnum
  left_join(planes, by = "tailnum") %>% 
  # Group by tailnum
  group_by(tailnum) %>% 
  # Summarize by counting by plane
  summarise(count_nyc_takeoff = n()) %>% 
  # Arrange in descending order
  arrange(desc(count_nyc_takeoff)) %>% 
  slice(1)

# N725MQ traveled the most times from New York City airports in 2013
```

## Problem 4: The `nycflights13` package includes a table (`weather`) that describes the weather during 2013. Use that table to answer the following questions:

```         
-   What is the distribution of temperature (`temp`) in July 2013? Identify any important outliers in terms of the `wind_speed` variable.
-   What is the relationship between `dewp` and `humid`?
-   What is the relationship between `precip` and `visib`?
```

```{r}

# Temperature in Jul
temp_jul_2013 <- weather %>% 
  filter(month == 7) %>% 
  pull(temp)

# Get histogram of temperature in july
temp_jul_hist <- hist(temp_jul_2013, breaks = 15, col = "blue", xlab = "Value", ylab = "Frequency", main = "Distribution of Temperature Jul-2013")

# Get all data where windspeed is not NA
weather_wind_speed <- 
  weather %>% 
  filter(!is.na(wind_speed))

# Give me all wind speeds more than 3 standard deviations from the mean
outlier_wind_speeds <- weather_wind_speed %>% 
  mutate(z = scale(wind_speed)) %>% 
  filter(abs(z) > 3) %>% 
  select(origin, year, month, day, hour, wind_speed)

print(outlier_wind_speeds)

# Dataframe with dewp and humidity
weather_dewp_humid <- weather %>% 
  filter(!is.na(dewp) & !is.na(humid)) %>% 
  select(dewp, humid) 

# Create scatter plot with correlation coefficient
scatter_dewp_humid <- ggplot(weather_dewp_humid, aes(dewp, humid)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(label = paste("Correlation =", round(cor(weather_dewp_humid$dewp, weather_dewp_humid$humid), 2)), x = max(weather_dewp_humid$dewp), y = min(weather_dewp_humid$humid), hjust = 1, vjust = 1) +
  labs(title = "Scatter Plot Dewp vs Humid", x = "dew point temperature (Fahrenheit)", y = "Relative Humidity")

plot(scatter_dewp_humid)
## Moderate positve correlation (0.51) between Dewp and Humidity

# Dataframe with precip and visib
weather_precip_visib <- weather %>% 
  filter(!is.na(precip) & !is.na(visib)) %>% 
  select(precip, visib) 

# Create scatter plot with correlation coefficient
scatter_precip_visib <- ggplot(weather_precip_visib, aes(precip, visib)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(label = paste("Correlation =", round(cor(weather_precip_visib$precip, weather_precip_visib$visib), 2)), x = max(weather_precip_visib$precip), y = min(weather_precip_visib$visib), hjust = 1, vjust = 1) +
  labs(title = "Scatter Plot Precip vs Visib", x = "Precipitation (inches)", y = "Visibility")

plot(scatter_precip_visib)
## No real correlation between preciptation and visibility

```

## Problem 5: Use the `flights` and `planes` tables to answer the following questions:

```         
-   How many planes have a missing date of manufacture?
-   What are the five most common manufacturers?
-   Has the distribution of manufacturer changed over time as reflected by the airplanes flying from NYC in 2013? (Hint: you may need to use case_when() to recode the manufacturer name and collapse rare vendors into a category called Other.)
```

```{r}
# Filter all planes where year of manufacture is NA 
missing_manu_plane <- filter(planes, is.na(year))
nrow(missing_manu_plane) #70 planes have no manufacture date

# Group the planes data frame by manufacturer and count the occurrences
manufacturer_counts <- planes %>% 
  # Replace AIRBUS INDUSTRIE with AIRBUS as these refer to the same company
  mutate(manufacturer = recode(manufacturer, 
                        "AIRBUS INDUSTRIE" = "AIRBUS")) %>%
  group_by(manufacturer) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))

# Select the top five manufacturers by count
top_manufacturers <- top_n(manufacturer_counts, n = 5, wt = count)
print(top_manufacturers) #BOEING, AIRBUS, BOMBARDIER INC, EMBRAER,MCDONNELL DOUGLAS	
# Get top manufacturer as a list
top_manufacturer_vector <- top_manufacturers$manufacturer

# Get all flights that werent cancelled
# Get only month, flight_no and tailnum
not_na_flights <- flights %>%  
  filter(!is.na(dep_time)) %>% 
  select (month, flight, tailnum)

# Left join unclassed flights with all planes data
# Join by tail number, filter out manufacturers that are NA
flights_with_manufacturer <- left_join(not_na_flights, 
                                       planes %>% 
                                         select (tailnum, manufacturer), by = "tailnum") %>% 
  filter(!is.na(manufacturer))

# Mutate the manufacture column to be Other when not present
# in the list of top 5 manufacuters
# Group by month (in 2013) and manufacturer, count n in each group
collapsed_flights <- flights_with_manufacturer %>%
  mutate(manufacturer = case_when(
    manufacturer %in% top_manufacturer_vector ~ as.character(manufacturer),
    TRUE ~ "Other"
  )) %>%
  group_by(month, manufacturer) %>%
  summarise(count = n())

# Calculate the total number of uncancelled flights per month
flights_per_month <- flights_with_manufacturer %>% 
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarise(total_flights_month = n())

# Join the two, divide flights per manufacturer by total flights
# This gives us percentage og flights per month per manufacturer
flights_by_manufacuter <- left_join(collapsed_flights, 
                                    flights_per_month, by = "month") %>%   
  mutate(manufacturer_percentage = count/total_flights_month)

# Create an stacked column chart
stacked_column_manufacturer_prop <-  ggplot(flights_by_manufacuter, aes(x = month, y = manufacturer_percentage, fill = manufacturer)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Proportion of flights per manufacturer all months in 2013", x = "Month", y = "Proportion") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1,12, by = 1)) + #scale x axis as months 1-12
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)  # Format y-axis labels as percentages

plot(stacked_column_manufacturer_prop)
```

## Problem 6: Use the `flights` and `planes` tables to answer the following questions:

```         
-   What is the oldest plane (specified by the tailnum variable) that flew from New York City airports in 2013?
-   How many airplanes that flew from New York City are included in the planes table?
```

```{r}

```

## Problem 7: Use the `nycflights13` to answer the following questions:

```         
-   What is the median arrival delay on a month-by-month basis in each airport?
-   For each airline, plot the median arrival delay for each month and origin airport.
```

```{r}

```

## Problem 8: Let's take a closer look at what carriers service the route to San Francisco International (SFO). Join the `flights` and `airlines` tables and count which airlines flew the most to SFO. Produce a new dataframe, `fly_into_sfo` that contains three variables: the `name` of the airline, e.g., `United Air Lines Inc.` not `UA`, the count (number) of times it flew to SFO, and the `percent` of the trips that that particular airline flew to SFO.

```{r}

```

And here is some bonus ggplot code to plot your dataframe

```
#| label: ggplot-flights-toSFO
#| message: false
#| warning: false

fly_into_sfo %>% 
  
  # sort 'name' of airline by the numbers it times to flew to SFO
  mutate(name = fct_reorder(name, count)) %>% 
  
  ggplot() +
  
  aes(x = count, 
      y = name) +
  
  # a simple bar/column plot
  geom_col() +
  
  # add labels, so each bar shows the % of total flights 
  geom_text(aes(label = percent),
             hjust = 1, 
             colour = "white", 
             size = 5)+
  
  # add labels to help our audience  
  labs(title="Which airline dominates the NYC to SFO route?", 
       subtitle = "as % of total flights in 2013",
       x= "Number of flights",
       y= NULL) +
  
  theme_minimal() + 
  
  # change the theme-- i just googled those , but you can use the ggThemeAssist add-in
  # https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggThemeAssist/index.html
  
  theme(#
    # so title is left-aligned
    plot.title.position = "plot",
    
    # text in axes appears larger        
    axis.text = element_text(size=12),
    
    # title text is bigger
    plot.title = element_text(size=18)
      ) +

  # add one final layer of NULL, so if you comment out any lines
  # you never end up with a hanging `+` that awaits another ggplot layer
  NULL
 
 
```

## Problem 9: Let's take a look at cancellations of flights to SFO. We create a new dataframe `cancellations` as follows

```{r}

cancellations <- flights %>% 
  
  # just filter for destination == 'SFO'
  filter(dest == 'SFO') %>% 
  
  # a cancelled flight is one with no `dep_time` 
  filter(is.na(dep_time))

```

I want you to think how we would organise our data manipulation to create the following plot. No need to write the code, just explain in words how you would go about it.

## Problem 10: On your own -- Hollywood Age Gap

The website https://hollywoodagegap.com is a record of *THE AGE DIFFERENCE IN YEARS BETWEEN MOVIE LOVE INTERESTS*. This is an informational site showing the age gap between movie love interests and the data follows certain rules:

-   The two (or more) actors play actual love interests (not just friends, coworkers, or some other non-romantic type of relationship)
-   The youngest of the two actors is at least 17 years old
-   No animated characters

The age gaps dataset includes "gender" columns, which always contain the values "man" or "woman". These values appear to indicate how the characters in each film identify and some of these values do not match how the actor identifies. We apologize if any characters are misgendered in the data!

The following is a data dictionary of the variables used

| variable            | class     | description                                                                                             |
|:--------------|:--------------|:------------------------------------------|
| movie_name          | character | Name of the film                                                                                        |
| release_year        | integer   | Release year                                                                                            |
| director            | character | Director of the film                                                                                    |
| age_difference      | integer   | Age difference between the characters in whole years                                                    |
| couple_number       | integer   | An identifier for the couple in case multiple couples are listed for this film                          |
| actor_1\_name       | character | The name of the older actor in this couple                                                              |
| actor_2\_name       | character | The name of the younger actor in this couple                                                            |
| character_1\_gender | character | The gender of the older character, as identified by the person who submitted the data for this couple   |
| character_2\_gender | character | The gender of the younger character, as identified by the person who submitted the data for this couple |
| actor_1\_birthdate  | date      | The birthdate of the older member of the couple                                                         |
| actor_2\_birthdate  | date      | The birthdate of the younger member of the couple                                                       |
| actor_1\_age        | integer   | The age of the older actor when the film was released                                                   |
| actor_2\_age        | integer   | The age of the younger actor when the film was released                                                 |

How would you explore this data set? Here are some ideas of tables/ graphs to help you with your analysis

-   How is `age_difference` distributed? What's the 'typical' `age_difference` in movies?

-   The `half plus seven\` rule. Large age disparities in relationships carry certain stigmas. One popular rule of thumb is the [half-your-age-plus-seven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_disparity_in_sexual_relationships#The_.22half-your-age-plus-seven.22_rule) rule. This rule states you should never date anyone under half your age plus seven, establishing a minimum boundary on whom one can date. In order for a dating relationship to be acceptable under this rule, your partner's age must be:

$$\frac{\text{Your age}}{2} + 7 < \text{Partner Age} < (\text{Your age} - 7) * 2$$ How frequently does this rule apply in this dataset?

-   Which movie has the greatest number of love interests?
-   Which actors/ actresses have the greatest number of love interests in this dataset?
-   Is the mean/median age difference staying constant over the years (1935 - 2022)?
-   How frequently does Hollywood depict same-gender love interests?

# Rubric

13/13: Problem set is 100% completed. Every question was attempted and answered, and most answers are correct. Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled. Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret the output. Multiple Github commits. Work is exceptional. I will not assign these often.

8/13: Problem set is 60--80% complete and most answers are correct. This is the expected level of performance. Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output). A few Github commits.

5/13: Problem set is less than 60% complete and/or most answers are incorrect. This indicates that you need to improve next time. I will hopefully not assign these often. Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed. No Github commits.
